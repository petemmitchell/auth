## Description
**Rails Auth** is taking a standard generated rails app, and adding user authentication from scratch.

## Information

I generated a new Rails 3.2.16 application, and then followed along with [Railscasts #250](http://railscasts.com/episodes/250-authentication-from-scratch-revised?view=asciicast). It was a great learning experience, and I look forward to learning how a Rails engine like Devise works.
